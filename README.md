> **CAUTION:** As a result of [Kubernetes API deprecation](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/07/18/api-deprecations-in-1-16/), Kyma can no longer be installed through the GCP Marketplace. That is why, we temporary disabled Kyma on GCP Marketplace until we make changes necessary to fix the installation issues.

# Kyma Marketplaces
